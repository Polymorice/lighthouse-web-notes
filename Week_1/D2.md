## Lecture

First part of today's lecture is an overview of the curriculum; including major focus of each week, test and fundamental topics on friday, and big projects. Second part of the lecture is a long coding question. The instructor went over the strategy then demonstrated refactoring process.

### Compass

- not a instruction manual
  to do list
  more and more vague (mimicking the real world)
  Google for it

## Today's work

### Pair programming

### coding: minimum value

The importance is to set the min to the first array value, instead of `0`.

`let minNum = numbers[0]`

### Pseudo code

Revisited the coding: loopylighthouse, for demonstration of pseudo code and refactoring.

```javascript
for (const num of nums) {
  let output = '';

  if (num % 3 === 0) {
    output += 'Loopy';
  }
  if (num % 4 === 0) {
    output += 'Lighthouse';
  }
  console.log(output === '' ? num : output);
}
```

Instead of repeating `console.log`, a variable is used for clarity, same as the use of `ternary operator`.

### coding: joinList.js

I used a string as a variable, but the code was not working. Eventually, I see a solution with string and word both variables, manipulating the word then added to the string. It worked!

### coding: dice-roll.js

I was stuck at this for hours. It should be a simple iteration then .push the result to the empty array, but for hours it remain empty. I began to question if I don't know how to iterate a function. Eventually I found a working code, which is essentially the same except variable names. Even my code works in this new file. I don't know if it was node.js acting up or I was very tired and frustrated, so I missed some trivial yet critical mistake.

Lesson learned: if I were stuck and I cannot see why, reboot the computer and move on to the next question.
