The question is to swap key values of two objects

SJ and I come up three solutions one after other.

1. small callback functions with its own small tesks (extract, swap and insert)
1. iteration for copying the objects to new ones then swap values
1. lastly simple swap as following

```js
let tempKey = object1[key1];
object1[key1] = object2[key2];
object2[key2] = tempKey;
```
