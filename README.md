# Horace's notes

## Summary

Updated on 2021/08/20

This repo contains all of the notes taken by [Horace](https://github.com/Polymorice) for the [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) Web Development Bootcamp.

Originally this repo is part of the Lighthouse Labs student's repos which is never visited beyond the initial setup. (I have secretly check on other graduates' GitHub pages.) I use it as my learning journal, recording of each day's journey at the bootcamp. Unfortunately, I have decided to take a in-depth and slow approach to learning programming, so I am about to withdraw from the program. I might not have the access to the materials, and I do not intend to get into the current materials at this moment, since I would prefer to do such exercise when I am readily prepared.

If I never get back to these learning materials. The state of this repo still serve as a accurate journal of my journey at the bootcamp.

If you are someone just starting out learning programming. It totally worth it to use the Lighthouse Labs in-house learning system [Compass](https://web.compass.lighthouselabs.ca/). The prep work is free to everyone, and it provide a rich content that is different from the typical coding tutorials. Just don't do any bootcamp, unless you have a really really **good** reason to do so.
